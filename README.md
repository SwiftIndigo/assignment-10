The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in our HTML. IDs are only used when one element on the page should have a particular style applied to it. 

The universal selector type is useful when dealing with documents containing multiple namespaces. 

The element selector selects an HTML element in your document. These are all useful for selecting and changing attributes of elements between HTML and CSS. Changing borders and background colors are a great time to use class selectors. ID's can be used to change font colors. 

I drew the inspiration from the image that I chose. The yellow in the backround seemed to be a nice complementary to the primary purple color in the image. There was a lot of grey as well so I used that as the border color.
